Use of ply Library
	> Python always checks for methods written with name 't_'. If it is written
	 then it checks for the regular expression and processes it.

	> Once it finds the reg expression, it constructs a FSM or NFSM and updates
	it lookup table. Lookup table consists of the states and their transitions.
	This table is similar to edges dicitonary. Except that this table is much 
	more big.

Use of Lexer States
	> Lexer state is more of a convenience function for allowing us to define a
	rule depending on where we are!
