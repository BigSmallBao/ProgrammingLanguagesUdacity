We will be breaking down the tags as follows

	words 					Hi
	start of the tags 		<
	word					b
	end of the tags 		>
	words					hello all


Tokens:
	> Lexical Analysis produces tokens i.e., all the words, punctuations, tags etc.,
	  will be seen as tokens
	> White spaces aren't considered as tokens
	> Token Value means, the value of the string it matched

// Refer to the examples of how the STRING & WORD token generators are written
Ordering of Lexical Analyzer token producer function is important.
For eg: "hello, "world"" can either be WORD  STRING tokes or WORD   WORD Tokens
									  hello, "world"        hello,  "world"
We get to 1 if STRING def. is written over word def.
