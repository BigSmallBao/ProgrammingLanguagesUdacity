> Chomsky states that utterances have syntactic rules (Formal Grammars)
	> By syntactic rules we mean what can a sentence be?
	> Formal Grammars stand for the grammars we use 

> Optional Parts of Languages
	> Often we come across sentences that have parts
	Eg: "I think" && "I think correctly" < The use of word "correctly" in the
	second sentence is strictly optional
