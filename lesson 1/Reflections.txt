Finite State Machines

Representing FSM: 
	> We can use Python Dicitionaries (or) Maps to represent the FSM
	> Eg: edges[(1, 'a')] = 2 mean we created an edge from 1 to 2 on a;



Ambiguity & Epsilon:
	> A FSM accepts a String s if there exists "even one path" from the start
	  state to any accepting state following

Non-Deterministic FSM
	> "Easy to write" fsms with epsilon transmitters or ambiguity

Every Non-Deterministic FSM has a corresponding Deterministic FSM that accepts 
exactly the same string
